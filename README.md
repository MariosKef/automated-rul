# Automated Machine Learning for Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Aircraft Engines

## Introduction

This repository holds the source code used for the work on the paper *Automated Machine Learning for Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Aircraft Engines*
(currently under review).

The work focuses on the difficulty of the estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL), emphasizes on the importance of careful pre-processing of the raw data
and recommends the usage of AutoML to perform the estimation task, by suggesting optimal pipelines. The proposed methodology is validated on the widely used CMAPSS
dataset.

This repository is the work of Marios Kefalas, PhD candidate at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.
